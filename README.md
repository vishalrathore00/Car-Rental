🚗 Car Rental Service – React App

This project is a Car Rental Web Application built using ReactJS.
It allows users to explore cars, book rentals, read blogs, and learn about services in a smooth and modern UI.

The project was set up with Create React App for quick bootstrapping and then customized for real-world car rental use cases.

📌 Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

▶️ npm start

Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000
to view it in your browser.

The page reloads automatically whenever you make changes. You can also check the console for any lint errors.

🧪 npm test

Runs the test runner in interactive watch mode.
Useful for verifying components and features.

🏗️ npm run build

Builds the app for production.

Bundles React in production mode

Optimizes the build for performance

Minifies files & generates hashed filenames

Your build will be inside the build/ folder, ready for deployment.

⚙️ npm run eject (Optional)

⚠️ This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

It copies all config files (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, giving you full control over the setup.
Most projects don’t need this, but it’s available if you want to deeply customize.

🚀 Deployment

The app can be deployed to any static hosting service (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.).
Check out the React Deployment Guide
for more options.
